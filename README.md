# Employment opportunities in Gaza
We aim to build the agency in Gaza with full transparency. Graduates working with us should have full visibility of all parts of the process of delivering projects.

If at any point you feel you have been treated unfairly, or that we have made a mistake, please talk to us. Our only aim is to make the agency successful enough to support the code academy and provide its graduates with work!

## How this works
New Opportunites will be posted as issues in this repository. You should manage your github notification so that you view notifications in a timely manner.

## How do I register interest in an opportunity
You should send me an email at eoin@gazaskygeeks.com.
  1. The name of the opportunity should be in the subject line of the email.
  2. You should describe any experience you have that you feel is relevent.
  3. You should describe any other commitment you have in the comming months
  
## How will projects be allocated
Projects will be allocated at my discression under a number of considerations
  1. Who has consistently demonstated good team working skills and a willingness for compromise and work with others.
  2. Who is best placed to successfully deliver the project
  3. Who was prompt responding to the issue

## How will I be remunerated
Right now we are doing our best to set a fair level of remuneration. If you feel that we have made a mistake please get in touch.

For the time being, remuneration will be based on the number of full time weeks spent on paid projects since graduating 

Number of weeks worked | pay per day ($USD)

 Less than 4           | 30
 Less than 12          | 35
 Less than 24          | 45
 Greater than 24       | 50 (subject to review)


## What should I do with projects that come from my own network
What you do with these projects is up to you.
